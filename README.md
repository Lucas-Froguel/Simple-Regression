# Simple-Regression
A simple non-linear regression program that uses cross-validation to select the amount of regularization and the polynomial degree that best fits the data. 

We introduce the class ''Non_Linear_Regression()'' that will perform a non-linear regression with regularization (using weight-decay). You give the data and the code return the best fit. 

We have also implemented a simple data set for testing, that extract point with user-defined noise level from a legendre polynomial of controlable degree.
